I am a statistician working in the research fields of healthcare and urban science. I have been living in New York City since 2014.  

I started my old blog in the beginning of 2018 to keep a better record of my work and share some of my experience in R programming. 

This blog was created from the R package `blogdown` written by Yihui Xie. Lots of thanks. 
All the posts were written exclusively using R Markdown.   
The banner photo was taken at Zakynthos Island in Greece in 2014.
