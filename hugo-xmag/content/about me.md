I am a statistician working in the fields of healthcare, epidemiology, environmental science and urban science. I have lived in New York since 2014. 
  
I started my old blog in the beginning of 2018 to keep a simple record of my work and share some of my experience in R programming. Later I upgraded to this one.  

This blog was created using R package **blogdown** written by Yihui Xie. All the posts were written exclusively using **RMarkdown**.  
  
The banner photo was in Zakynthos, Greece in 2014.
