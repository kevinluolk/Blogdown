Drake is a powerful tool for automatic reproducible workflow. Drake has great documentations online thus here I only show a simple example working with Rmarkdown. Rmarkdown file could be very slow to generate due to the calculations involved. And every small revise make you wait a long time if you re-render the file. When we use drake we can do all the calculations in advance thus the file rendering is super fast since we only need to re-calculate the revised object. 

Using `SHAPforxgboost` as an example:

```{r}
# if needed, update drake
if(packageVersion("drake") < "7.4") install.packages("drake")
if(packageVersion("SHAPforxgboost") < "0.0.2") devtools::install_github("liuyanguu/SHAPforxgboost")

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
library("drake")
library("SHAPforxgboost")
library("here")
})

# assign a place to store intermediate objects
cache_path <- here("Drake_Cache")
if(!dir.exists(cache_path))dir.create(cache_path)
cache <- drake_cache(path = cache_path)

```

The **drake_plan** takes self-defined functions to create each target. All the functions are usually written in a seperate script. 
```{r}
get.xgb.mod <- function(dataX){
  y_var <- "diffcwv" 
  # hyperparameter tuning results
  param_dart <- list(objective = "reg:linear",  # For regression
                   nrounds = 366,
                   eta = 0.018,
                   max_depth = 10,
                   gamma = 0.009,
                   subsample = 0.98,
                   colsample_bytree = 0.86)

  mod <- xgboost::xgboost(data = as.matrix(dataX), 
                        label = as.matrix(dataXY_df[[y_var]]), 
                       xgb_param = param_dart, nrounds = param_dart$nrounds,
                       verbose = FALSE, nthread = parallel::detectCores() - 2,
                       early_stopping_rounds = 8)
  return(mod)
}

# ...
# define more functions if needed
# ...
```

Markdown all the results to the final report. The great advantage is that since all the figures were done and stored before the markdown process, if you modify a figure, only that figure needs to be rerun.



```{r}
my_plan <- drake_plan(
  dataX = data.table::copy(dataXY_df[,-"diffcwv"]),
  xgb_mod = get.xgb.mod(dataX),
  shap_long = shap.prep(xgb_model = xgb_mod, X_train = dataX, top_n = 4),
  # make a diluted (faster) summary plot showing only top 4 variables:
  fig1 = shap.plot.summary(shap_long, dilute = 10),
  fig2 = shap.plot.dependence(data_long = shap_long, x = 'dayint', y = 'dayint', color_feature = 'Column_WV'),
  fig3 = shap.plot.dependence(data_long = shap_long, x = 'dayint', y = 'Column_WV', color_feature = 'Column_WV'),
  
  report = rmarkdown::render(
    knitr_in("Code/drake_md_report.Rmd"),
    output_format = rmarkdown::html_document(toc = TRUE))
)

nemia_config <- drake_config(my_plan, cache = cache) # show the dependency
# vis_drake_graph(nemia_config, from = names(nemia_config$layout))
vis_drake_graph(nemia_config)

# run the plan
make(my_plan, cache = cache)
```

Notice that it is not a good idea to run drake within a rmarkdown file, which is how I write this post. 
Drake workflow should be an R script that uses Rmarkdown as the output tool.
So I cannot really render this post as it is. 

Here is how the dependency graph looks like:

If we add an extra figure, only this figure needs to made:
![](/post/2019-09-15-drake-powerful-tool-for-automatic-reproducible-workflow_files/dependency plot2.PNG)
