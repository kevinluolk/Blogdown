**`drake`** is a powerful tool for automatic reproducible workflow. I found it a perfect match when used together with `RMarkdown`. There are great documentations online for `drake` thus here I only show a simple example working with `RMarkdown`.   

`RMarkdown` file could be very slow to generate if lots of calculations are involved. Any small revise makes you rerun everything. When we use `drake` we can do all the calculations in advance thus the rendering is super fast since we only need to re-do the revised object. 

Using `SHAPforxgboost` as an example:

```{r}
# if needed, update drake
if(packageVersion("drake") < "7.4") install.packages("drake")
if(packageVersion("SHAPforxgboost") < "0.0.3") install.packages("SHAPforxgboost")

suppressPackageStartupMessages({
  library("drake")
  library("SHAPforxgboost")
  library("here")
})

# assign a place to store intermediate objects
cache_path <- here("Drake_Cache")
if(!dir.exists(cache_path))dir.create(cache_path)
cache <- drake_cache(path = cache_path)

```

The **drake_plan** takes self-defined functions to create each target. All the functions are usually written in a seperate script. 
```{r}
get.xgb.mod <- function(dataX){
  y_var <- "diffcwv" 
  # hyperparameter tuning results
  param_dart <- list(objective = "reg:linear",  # For regression
                   nrounds = 366,
                   eta = 0.018,
                   max_depth = 10,
                   gamma = 0.009,
                   subsample = 0.98,
                   colsample_bytree = 0.86)

  mod <- xgboost::xgboost(data = as.matrix(dataX), 
                        label = as.matrix(dataXY_df[[y_var]]), 
                       xgb_param = param_dart, nrounds = param_dart$nrounds,
                       verbose = FALSE, nthread = parallel::detectCores() - 2,
                       early_stopping_rounds = 8)
  return(mod)
}

# ...
# define more functions if needed
# ...
```

Markdown all the results to the final report. The great advantage is that since all the figures were done and stored before the markdown process, if you modify a figure, only that figure needs to be rerun.



```{r}
my_plan <- drake_plan(
  dataX = data.table::copy(dataXY_df[,-"diffcwv"]),
  xgb_mod = get.xgb.mod(dataX),
  shap_long = shap.prep(xgb_model = xgb_mod, X_train = dataX, top_n = 4),
  # make a diluted (faster) summary plot showing only top 4 variables:
  fig1 = shap.plot.summary(shap_long, dilute = 10),
  fig2 = shap.plot.dependence(data_long = shap_long, x = 'dayint', y = 'dayint', color_feature = 'Column_WV'),
  fig3 = shap.plot.dependence(data_long = shap_long, x = 'dayint', y = 'Column_WV', color_feature = 'Column_WV'),
  
  report = `RMarkdown`::render(
    knitr_in("Code/drake_md_report.Rmd"),
    output_format = `RMarkdown`::html_document(toc = TRUE))
)

nemia_config <- drake_config(my_plan, cache = cache) # show the dependency
# vis_drake_graph(nemia_config, from = names(nemia_config$layout))
vis_drake_graph(nemia_config)

# run the plan
make(my_plan, cache = cache)
```

Notice that it is not a good idea to run `drake` within a `RMarkdown` file as `drake` workflow should be an R script that uses `RMarkdown` as the output tool. So I cannot really render this post as it is. But these code can run as 

Here is how the dependency graph looks like:

If we add an extra figure, only this figure (the black _fig3_) needs to made:

Here is [how the md file looks like on Github](https://github.com/liuyanguu/Blogdown/blob/master/hugo-xmag/Code/drake_md_report.Rmd)  

And the `drake` work plan generates a markdown results automatcially ("drake_md_report.html") which looks like this:
