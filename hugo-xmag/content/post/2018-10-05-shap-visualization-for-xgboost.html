<h1>Background</h1>
<p>I will illustrate here the application of SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlnation) values to visualize the efforts of features on the outcome variable in a XGBoost model.<br />
The function was developed by <em>Scott Lundberg</em> in Python <a href="https://github.com/slundberg/shap">Github Link</a> and then combined into <em>xgboost</em> with one visualization function <em>xgb.plot.shap</em>. But we can make better summary figures as those functions in its Python package in more flexible ways by extracting the SHAP values and plot by ourselves.</p>

<h1>Summary plot</h1>
<ul>
<li>Using <code>geom_sina</code> from <code>ggforce</code> and <code>ggplot2</code></li>
<li>We can see clearly for the most influential variable on the top: Monthly water cost. A Higher cost is associated with the declined share of temporary housing. But a very low cost has a strong impact on the increased share of temporary housing<br />
</li>
<li>The effects of binary variables are highly distinctive. The second variable shows that Resettled housing is highly unlikely to be temporary, so does being close to wells as water sources.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>## make SHAP score by decreasing order</code></pre>
